        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>Jack Dorsey is an American computer programmer and entrepreneur widely known as a co-founder and CEO of Twitter, and as the founder and CEO of Square, a mobile payments company. Jack Dorsey, now a multi-millionaire, had modest beginnings. He was raised in St. Louis Missouri in a Catholic family. Dorsey gained a great love for maps and the city of Saint Louis at an early age. The Dorsey family owned a police scanner which sparked his interests in dispatch systems, transportation, communication, computers, and connecting people. While he had always dreamed of being a politician, his talents for technology showed him the great impact he could have. Dorsey attended the Missouri University of Science and Technology before subsequently transferring to New York University, but he dropped out. He first came up with the idea that became Twitter at New York University. In college he began to hack computers and eventually hacked into a programming company in New York, later emailing them that they had a hole in their website and letting them know that he was a programmer in need of a job. He was later hired and met people who shared his vision of creating something that could connect the world together. In about two weeks a prototype of Twitter was created.</p>
